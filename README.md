# RaYCiSS
Restores the original Space Pirates in Rayman Redemption.
This software is supposed to be version independent to Rayman Redemption, so whatever new update comes out to the game you can use the same patcher to bring back the original pirates. This has been tested on version 1.1.0 and 1.1.1. 

The program was built with Monodevelop and .NET Core SDK v3.8 however you should be able to compile this on Windows with Visual Studio too. Ports to other languages are highly welcome!

### DISCLAIMER
This tool has NO racist intention in mind! This only brings back the original character sprites which have been ok for the past 20 years.
Do NOT use this program if you feel offended by blue space pirates with big yellow lips. The main goal of this program is preservation.

# Usage
Simply drag and drop your "data.win" into the Windows executable or the console. The tool will inject an older texture map with the original sprites and remap the sprites to the older texture map.
